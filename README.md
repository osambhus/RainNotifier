# RainNotifier
This is a simple application deployed on a AWS instance tied to a cron job. This will basically send a text message out the weather forecast for the day. 


I am usually in a lot of rush in the morning everyday and end up not checking the weather app most of the times. And then I end up getting wet in the rain while coming back or in the morning itself because I'm not carrying an umbrella.
